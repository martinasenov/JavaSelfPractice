Question-2.The Index of the first Non-repeating Vowel
Given a string, write a method to find the index of the first non-repeating vowel (a, e, i, o, u) in it and return it.
If it doesn't exist, return -1. Assume that string is not empty, and all the character of the String is lowercase.

Try to solve with Map data structure like using a Map<Character, Integer>.

Example-1:
Input: “google”
Output: 5
Explanation: only e is non-repeated vowel, and its index is 5

Example-2:
Input: “responsible”
Output: 4
Explanation: e is repeated, "o" and "i" are not repeated, o is the first non-repeating vowel

Example-3:
Input: “mood”
Output: -1
Explanation: o is repeated, no non-repeating vowel.
